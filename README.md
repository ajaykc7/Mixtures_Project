# Mixtures_Project
a Java project that implements the LU decomposition method to solve linear equations with large (n>=50) unknown variables.
•	Implemented a BigFraction class to store the numbers that performs basic arithmetic calculations. Variables are stored as a BigFraction to avoid truncation and restore accuracy
•	Enforced LU decomposition method to work with large number of variables
