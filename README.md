# Mixtures_Project
a Java project that implements the LU decomposition method to solve linear equations with large (n>=50) unknown variables.The project Implements a BigFraction class to store the numbers that performs basic arithmetic calculations. Variables are stored as a BigFraction to avoid truncation and restore accuracy. LU decomposition method is enforced to work with large number of variables and optimize the process
